## Description
This repo contains the Create React App project for my personal website, which you can see live at [carlobollini.com](https://carlobollini.com), powered by Cloudflare Pages.

It is written using React (of course), Typescript, Bootstrap for the UI.
Content is being added regularly, and i'm planning to add more and more in the near future.

### Dark theme when?
Whenever Bootstrap decides it's time to [release](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/pull/35857) it :)
